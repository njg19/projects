# Projects Portfolio

This repo contains three projects that showcase different areas of data work:  
- **EDA & Visualization** with Washington, DC weather data  
- **ETL Pipeline** using MongoDB and MySQL  
- **Machine Learning** demo detecting bias in social media posts  

## Projects

### 1. Washington, DC Weather Dashboard - [Link](https://njg19.github.io/projects/EDA/)
Interactive HTML dashboard for exploring DC weather data. Uses Plotly.js.

### 2. ETL Pipeline Segment - [Link](https://njg19.github.io/projects/ETL/etl_pipeline.html)
Demonstration of an Extract–Transform–Load process.  
Working with MongoDB and MySQL using Pandas library moving and cleaning stock data as well as financial tweets.

### 3. ML Bias Detection in Social Media - [Link](https://njg19.github.io/projects/ML/social_media_bias.html)
Machine learning for analyzing social media posts and detecting potential bias.  
Includes preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and analysis.

### 4. MVP Daily News Web App - [Link](https://github.com/kmd2zjw/CS4260-Daily-Bugle)
Collaborated to develop a lightweight news application prototype with role-based authentication and ad/click tracking to simulate monetization. Built with Node.js and Express, containerized with Docker for portability, and designed to demonstrate core backend functionality for a scalable media platform.
